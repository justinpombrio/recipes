# Our Favorite Recipes

These are our favorite recipes. They are mostly adapted from
[The Moosewood Cookbook](http://www.molliekatzen.com/books_moosewood_cookbook.php)
by Mollie Katzen, and
[The Gourmet Vegetarian Slow Cooker](https://www.amazon.com/Gourmet-Vegetarian-Slow-Cooker-Sophisticated/dp/158008074X)
by Lynn Alley.

Recipes are generally
[not copyrightable](https://paleoflourish.com/recipe-copyright/) in the US,
except for any _narrative flair_ they add to the dry instructions. The recipes
here are flair-free, so you are free to copy them. Though attribution is always
nice (either to us, or to the source we cite).
